I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though the classes seemed to be defined correctly in my `tailwind.config.js` file and the classes were included in my CSS file. The issue specifically occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within custom styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file.  The styles defined with `@apply` were not being reflected on the elements. For example, I defined a custom style like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'sans': ['Roboto', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    function ({ addUtilities }) {
      addUtilities({
        '.custom-text-style': {
          '@apply text-lg font-bold text-gray-800': ' ',
        },
      });
    },
  ],
};
```

But the `.custom-text-style` class didn't apply the expected styles (text-lg, font-bold, text-gray-800).
